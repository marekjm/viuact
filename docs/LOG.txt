-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This file describes the history of, and events that occured during, the Viuact
compiler development.

On every day when something related to the project is done, a relevant entry is
made in this file. An example entry looks like this:

>   TITLE OF THE ENTRY
>   (2018-12-22 16:29)
>
>   Contents of the entry.

Contents of each entry may be short (e.g. "A new issue was added."), or long
(e.g. a description of how a problem was resolved, or summary of a discussion).

FIRST ENTRY
(2018-12-22 16:31)

The log file was established. It will be maintained as a log of what happened
during Viuact development, when, and why. I decided to start writing it after
a discussion with Krzysztof - we came to the conclusion (which was put forward
by Krzysztof) that *whatever* is done that has its root cause in the Viuact
project should be documented. This way we will be able to put the entire
history of the project and its supporting work inside the final "paper" (or
whatever it will be called).
