The specification\nwill be a little bit less featurefull than what is described in 509ee8:\n\n- it will not mandate a special \"lispy\" syntax for interface files,\n  instead opting for JSON (faster to implement as we do not have to\n  write parser rules and logic)\n- it will not allow \"Example/mod.lisp\" to mean the same thing as\n  \"Example.lisp\" (as in Rust)\n\nThe feature cuts are due to tight time budget.", "timestamp": 1545209276.054227}
