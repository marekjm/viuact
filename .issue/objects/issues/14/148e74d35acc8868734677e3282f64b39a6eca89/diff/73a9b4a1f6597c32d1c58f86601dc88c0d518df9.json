This requires answering several\nquestions:\n\n- how do they capture their environment (by copy? by reference?)\n- how is the fact that a function is a closure detected\n- are closures mutable or not\n- what are the constraints under which closures work (e.g. the number of\n  allocated registers may be limited)\n\n...and probably more.\n\nThe first thing that may surprise a programmer is that closures capture\ntheir environment by copy. This is much easier to implement while\nensuring correctness. We don't have time for a better implementation due\nto a very tight time budget."}, "author": {"author.email": "marekjm@ozro.pw", "author.name": "Marek Marecki"}, "timestamp": 1545173102.352036}, {"action": "push-tags", "params": {"tags": []}, "author": {"author.email": "marekjm@ozro.pw", "author.name": "Marek Marecki"}, "timestamp": 1545173102.352038}, {"action": "push-milestones", "params": {"milestones": []}, "author": {"author.email": "marekjm@ozro.pw", "author.name": "Marek Marecki"}, "timestamp": 1545173102.352041}]
